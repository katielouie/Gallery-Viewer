## A program to organize my art

This is a program to **store and organize my artworks**. This is made for a way to keep my artworks organized. 
I often enjoy making artworks but right now it's all in one folder - *hopefully* this helps me organize.


This program can store a piece's:
- Title
- Medium
- Subject
